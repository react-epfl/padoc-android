This is the ReadMe file for the Padoc library for Android

###TODO & BUGS

* Bluetooth paring dialog is not always dismissed, functionality is not compromised but it is still annoying.
* Create general functions that automate the multiple necessary steps to join a mesh, or even to start scanning properly, etc.
* Integrate peers names and hops and make them available.
* Detect and implement deconnections!
* Implement priority peers/leaf nodes.
* Detect when bluetooth pairing/connection did not work. (out of reach, etc)
* Sometimes the server socket is null and crashes (listenusingrfcommwithservicerecord returns null)
* Implement connection when the other device is already paired
* Try connections without bluetooth discovery
* Turn Wifi on automatically
* Get Bluetooth and Wifi status when starting
