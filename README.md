###TODO

* Bluetooth paring dialog is not always dismissed, functionality is not compromised but it is still annoying.
* Create general functions that automate the multiple necessary steps to join a mesh, or even to start scanning properly, etc.
* Integrate peers names and make them available.
* Detect deconnections!
* Implement priority peers/leaf nodes.
* Detect when bluetooth pairing/connection did not work. (out of reach, etc)
